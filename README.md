This repo is based on [Husky Control Docker](https://github.com/j3soon/docker-ros-husky). Provides quick starting guide of using Husky A200 on ROS 1 Melodic with ZED2i stereo camera.

## Prerequisites

Hardware:

- Husky base
- Power supply cable (for recharging the battery)
- USB cable
- ZED2i Camera
- NVIDIA GPU and CUDA Installed

We choose not to use the MINI-ITX computer, and control Husky directly through a Jetson board or laptop.

More information such as User Guide and Manual Installation steps can be found in [this post](https://j3soon.com/cheatsheets/clearpath-husky/).

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/HuskyKingdom/husky_road_making.git
cd husky_road_making
```

Installation of udev rules must be done on the host machine:

```sh
./setup_udev_rules.sh
```

You should see `done` if everything works correctly.

You need to reboot the host machine to make the udev rules take effect.


- On amd64 machine:

```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile -t yhs/embodiedvln:latest .
```

- On arm64 machine:

```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile.jetson -t yhs/embodiedvln:latest .
```

If you want to build an image that supports multiple architectures, please refer to the [build workflow](./.github/workflows/build.yaml).


## Installing ZED Camera Dependencies

Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit following [this](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) instruction.


Then install the ZED SDK and ZED ROS Wrappper, you need to install them with respect to your CUDA version and Linux version, note that in our implementation we use the following dependencies:

- [ZED_SDK_Ubuntu18_cuda12.1_v4.0.8.zstd.run](https://stereolabs.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/zedsdk/4.0/ZED_SDK_Ubuntu18_cuda12.1_v4.0.8.zstd.run)
- [ZEDWrapper-tag-v4.0.5](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper)



1. Install ZED udev rules on the host:

```
./zed_rules.sh
```

2. Enter the docker with cuda support, display and network support:

```
xhost +si:localuser:root

docker run --gpus all -it --network host -v /dev:/dev -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --privileged yhs/embodiedvln:latest bash
```


3. Download & Install ZED SKD in `Home` directory:

```
cd home/ && curl -O https://stereolabs.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/zedsdk/4.0/ZED_SDK_Ubuntu18_cuda12.1_v4.0.8.zstd.run

chmod +x ZED_SDK_Ubuntu18_cuda12.1_v4.0.8.zstd.run

./ZED_SDK_Ubuntu18_cuda12.1_v4.0.8.zstd.run -- silent
```

4. With the corresponded verion of the CUDA Toolkit installed, creating CUDA symlink by the following:

```
sudo ln -s /usr/local/cuda-<Your Version> /usr/local/cuda
```

5. Install the ROS Wrapper:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src

git clone --branch v4.0.5 --recursive https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper.git

cd ../

rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

source ./devel/setup.bash
```

5. Launch ROS Node:

```
roslaunch zed_wrapper zed2i.launch
```

## Running

### Running the container

Connect and power on the Husky.

Open terminal and run the following to start a container from local image:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

### Start Husky Core Nodes

Run the following to start all husky core nodes:

```
./docker-exec-bringup.sh
```

<!-- ### Setting lidar
Power on your lidar and connect the ethernet cable to the laptop. Open a NEW terminal and run the following:

```
sudo ifconfig <port_name> 192.168.3.100
sudo route add 192.168.1.201 <port_name>
```
Replace `<port_name>` with the port name of your connected ethernet port. If you are not sure with this, you could check the name of ethernet ports by `ifconfig -a`.

Once finish setting up the ip configs, on the same terminal, open the runnning container in IT mode and run the lidar nodes:

```
docker exec -it ros-melodic-husky bash

roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16_points.launch
```
You can find more supports on lidar nodes in [Velodyne ROS](https://wiki.ros.org/velodyne). -->


### Running Embodied Core Node

Open a NEW terminal, and enter the running container:

```
docker exec -it embodiedvln bash
```

Build the package and source the envrionment:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```


Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the pid node:

```
rosrun embodied_vln embodied_core.py 
```




## Uninstall

Uninstallation of udev rules must be done on the host machine:

```sh
./remove_udev_rules.sh
```

You should see `done` if everything works correctly.
